The course focused on JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL, equipping me with essential skills in these technologies. I developed a strong foundation in JavaScript, mastering key concepts such as higher-order functions, asynchronous functions, and promises. Collaborative work was emphasised, and I gained valuable experience working in pairs. Furthermore, I gained proficiency in unit testing techniques and applied principles of Test-Driven Development, utilising Jest Matchers to ensure the delivery of high-quality code.",
