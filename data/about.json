  "description": "Hi, I'm Jason! I'm a Civil Engineer wanting to transition into Software Engineering.\n\nAs a Civil Engineer turned Software Developer, I bring a unique perspective to the world of programming.\n\nI began my professional journey as a Civil Engineer, contributing to projects such as HS2 and Hurontario Light Rail Transit. In these projects, I worked as a designer, delivering intricate designs and conducting in-depth structural analyses for clients. However, as I completed these projects, I realised that my true passion lay in coding.\n\nDuring my time as a Civil & Structural Engineer, I discovered my passion for programming. This started my journey to become a Software Developer, prompting me to pursue further education and expand my skill set. I dedicated myself to online courses in JavaScript, honing my coding skills through platforms like FreeCodeCamp and Codecademy. Seeking a more immersive learning experience, I enrolled in Northcoders' 13-week Software Development Course. Throughout this course, I successfully completed several projects that showcase my growth and abilities. You can explore these projects in the dedicated 'Projects' section of my portfolio.\n\nSince graduating from the Bootcamp Course, I have remained committed to continuous learning. I actively challenge myself by regularly taking on coding katas. Additionally, I have developed both the backend and frontend of this very website you are currently exploring.\n\nBelow is a timeline of my career; feel free to take a look!\n\nNow, I am ready for my next adventure in the world of Software Development. If you have any exciting opportunities or would like to connect, I am just a message away!",
